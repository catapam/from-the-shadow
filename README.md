# Design

* The design was inspired in late 90s technology, with pixelated characters and a static background;
* The game happens in medieval ages, and the main character is a wizzard;
* The enemies are unkown creatures, with exotic names reinforcing the little is known about them;
* All effects are small movements that give the impression of hitting the other player;
* The shadow is primarily round, but the shading cover the whole screen representing the evil coming from it, the shadow 'shines' pure darkness;
* Classic fight game bars are used to show Health, stamina/mana, and experience;
* The gameplay is inspired in RPG turn-by-turn games, where attack defence, stategy and luck are at play all at the same time;
* Difficulty increases as rounds and levels are going by;
* The hero is 'illuminated' and can be revived by a divine light that is seen also when the hero recharges health;
* The hero runs out of the screen to next round while the screen gets darker when an enemy is defeated, engaging the player to check what comes next;
* Next turn will bring new random enemies and backgrounds, enter in depth in the story and universe;
